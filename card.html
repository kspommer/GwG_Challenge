			<p class="description">Lucky grew up in an urban high rise apartment, rarely spending time outdoors.  When we started walking, she was terrified to leave her house.  Each day we could venture a bit further. Now, she equates my name with a walk and doesn't even look back when we leave.  We both have a lot of fun on our adventures!</p>
